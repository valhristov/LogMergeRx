# Overview

Simple application for reading log files in CSV format.

# Use

When open you will be prompted with a open file dialog to select a log file (there are some example in the Logs directory) and the application will monitor the changes in this file and add the newly added entries.

You can filter the entries by level and regular expression.

There is rudimentary search and highlight.

# TODO

- rewrite the UI in WinUI 3
- support several files
- better UX (tabs in the titlebar for example)
- support for large files (data virtualization)
